TODO

01.17.2008
- Add the ability for extending Jerkbot's event system so that the users can add events on the fly w/o
  having to modify the various classes, namely IRCEventFactory and InternalEventParser. - r0bby

- Add InviteEvent [done] - r0bby implemented it

- Add ChannelListEvent [partially done - just needs to be written into InternalEventParser
  w/ buffering until 323 is encountered.] (321-323 is /LIST) - r0bby implemented most of it.

- We have a few slight bugs related to joinChannel() and channelSay()
