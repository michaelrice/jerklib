To run this example, you need to download Groovy from http://groovy.codehaus.org/

1) Set up all the env. variables
2) change to the src directory
3) type: groovy -cp bin/jerklib.jar jerklib/examples/groovy/jerkbot/Jerkbot.groovy

Currently the bot does nada, but it was never intended to do anything to begin with.
This was just to show that it IS possible to write a bot using Groovy!
