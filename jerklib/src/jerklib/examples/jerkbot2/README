This is a VERY simple example of how to write a bot with Jerklib.

==Running==
java -cp jerklib.jar jerklib.examples.jerkbot2.jerkbot.Jerkbot

==Using the bot==
This bot is simple like i said. The bot will join the channel you specify
which is hard-coded in the Jerkbot class, it will then say "Hai 2u"
when it is finished joining the channel and it is synced.
The bot has two commands currently.

Typing "~users" (without quotes) will cause it to output the message seen below:
Users in #example are: jerkbot

==Killing the bot from IRC==
Typing "~quit <password>" (without quotes) in a private message with the bot will cause the bot to
disconnect from IRC. '<password>' is passed into the constructor of the QuitOperation.
This password is case-sensitive.
